One big issue can happen in the union, if two threads try to do union(a,b) and union(b,a) simultaneously.
The two execute :
 
 
 1: x = this.find(a);
 1: y = this.find(b);
 2: x = this.find(b);
 2: y = this.find(a);
 1: this.link(x, y); // We have x --> y --> y, OK
 2: this.link(x, y); // We have then y --> x but x-->y  
 
Then we have an infinite loop a --> b --> a .....
